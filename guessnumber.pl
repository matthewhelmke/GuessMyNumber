# Guess my number game

# --A Perl version of a silly game I made on my programmable
#   calculator when I was bored in math class in 1987, with a couple of
#   additions like input validation and computer guesses.

The computer will select a random whole number between 1 and 100.

player will get a turn. Each of you are aware of the other's guesses.
The first one to guess the number correctly will win. Try to guess in
as few turns as possible.

Here we go!
