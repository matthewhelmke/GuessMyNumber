# GuessMyNumber
**Guess My Number** is a silly little game that I heard about and then first wrote a version on my programmable calculator during a bored moment in math class in 1987. My versions here are hopefully cleanly written and include a couple of additions like input validation and computer guesses.

I assume you will run each of these on Linux.

I have chapters in [one of my books](https://www.amazon.com/Ubuntu-Linux-Unleashed-2021-14th-dp-0136778852/dp/0136778852/) for shell scripting, Python, Perl, and PHP. I figured they are all must-haves. The other languages are here because I was in the mood to either remember or learn how to use it for this simple use case that day.

I wrote these, in this order:
- Python
- Bash
- C
- Perl
- PHP

Code contributions via PR welcome. This repo exists because all my other work on GitHub is in repos I don't own and I thought I should have something here that is mine.
