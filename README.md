# GuessMyNumber

**Guess My Number** is a silly little game that I first heard about and wrote a version of on my [Casio fx-7000G](https://rskey.org/fx7000g) programmable calculator during a bored moment in math class in 1987. The versions here include a couple of additions like input validation and computer guesses.

This repo exists because all my other work on GitHub is in repos I don't own, often in private repos, and I thought I should have something here that is mine.

I assume you will run each of these on Linux.

I have chapters in [one of my books](https://www.amazon.com/Ubuntu-Linux-Unleashed-2021-14th-dp-0136778852/dp/0136778852/) for shell scripting, Python, Perl, and PHP. I figured they are all must-have languages here. The other languages are here because I was in the mood to either remember or learn how to use it for this simple use case that day.

I wrote these, in this order:

- Python                                                (`guessnumber.py`)
- Bash                                                  (`guessnumber.sh`)
- C                                                     (`guessnumber.c`)
- Perl                                                  (`guessnumber.pl`)
- PHP                                                   (`guessnumber.php`)
- Racket (based on Scheme, which is based on Lisp)      (`guessnumber.rkt`)
- COBOL                                                 (`guessnumber.cob`)
- Go                                                    (`guessnumber.go`)
- Ruby                                                  (`guessnumber.rb`)
- Java                                                  (`guessnumber.java`)
- Fortran                                               (`guessnumber.f90`)
- JavaScript in an HTML context that runs in a browser  (`guessnumber.html`)
- JavaScript for the command line using Node.js         (`guessnumber.js`)
- Rust (using Cargo)                                    (`guessnumber.rs`)
- R                                                     (`guessnumber.r`)

Some of these are being used far outside of typical use for the language and the game is not a natural fit. That was part of the fun and challenge for me, along with stretching my thinking a bit. This whole repo is just for silly fun, right?

Future ideas/plans:

- Dunno. Maybe Erlang? Forth? Something else??

Code contributions via PR are welcome, but thus far everything here has been written by me. I'll edit this note if that changes.
