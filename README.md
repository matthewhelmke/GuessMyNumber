# GuessMyNumber
A Python version of a silly game I made on my programmable calculator when I was bored in math class in 1987, with a couple of additions like input validation and computer guesses.

At the moment, this is command line only. You must have Python 3 installed.

To run on Linux, from the directory where the file exists, enter:
```bash
./guessnumber.py
```

Code contributions via PR welcome. Low hanging fruit include instructions to run on MacOS and Windows (I don't have systems running either).

Comments about how lame anyone thinks this silly little game is are sent to `/dev/null`, LOL.
