# GuessMyNumber
Versions of a silly game I first wrote on my programmable calculator when I was bored in math class in 1987, with a couple of additions like input validation and computer guesses.

It is assumed that all these are being run on Linux.

Code contributions via PR welcome. Really, this repo only exists because all my other work on GitHub is in repos I don't own and I thought I should have something here.
