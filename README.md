# GuessMyNumber
A modern, Python version of a silly game I made on my programmable calculator when I was bored in math class in 1987, with a couple of additions like input validation and computer guesses.

Code contributions via PR welcome. Comments about how lame anyone thinks this silly little game is are sent to /dev/null.
